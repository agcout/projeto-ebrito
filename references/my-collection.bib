abstract = {Aim To consider the role of local colonization and extinction rates in explaining the generation and maintenance of species richness gradients at the regional scale. Location A Mediterranean biome (oak forests, deciduous forests, shrublands, pinewoods, firwoods, alpine heathlands, crops) in Catalonia, Spain. Methods We analysed the relative importance of direct and indirect effects of community size in explaining species richness gradients. Direct sampling effects of community size on species richness are predicted by Hubbell's neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography. The greater the number of individuals in a locality, the greater the number of species expected by random direct sampling effects. Indirect effects are predicted by the abundance–extinction hypothesis, which states that in more productive sites increased population densities and reduced extinction rates may lead to high species richness. The study system was an altitudinal gradient of forest bird species richness. Results We found significant support for the existence of both direct and indirect effects of community size in species richness. Thus, both the neutral and the abundance–extinction hypotheses were supported for the altitudinal species rich-ness gradient of forest birds in Catalonia. However, these mechanisms seem to drive variation in species richness only in low-productivity areas; in high-productivity areas, species richness was uncorrelated with community size and productivity measures. Main conclusions Our results support the existence of a geographical mosaic of community-based processes behind species richness gradients, with contrasting abundance–extinction dynamics and sampling effects in areas of low and high productivity.},

@article{Ramirez-Flores2015,
abstract = {We analyzed the topological structure (e.g., links per species, connectance, core-periphery analyses, specialization, nestedness, modularity) of plant-bee interactions of four areas in Mexico. We used qualitative data (binary networks). Mexico exhibits a complex geography and community variation that can affect bee networks. Network architecture is variable within large spatial scales, thus our results should vary according to site characteristics (La Mancha and Totula in Veracruz, Carrillo Puerto in Quintana Roo, and the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan valley, in Puebla), type of vegetation, endemism, altitude, size of area sampled. Network topology varied among sites, and the presence of nested or modular patterns was analyzed for robustness to simulated species extinctions. The lowest species richness was recorded for the Quintana Roo site (15 plant, 25 bee species), and the highest for the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan valley site (88 plant, 231 bee species). There was a tendency to have more connected networks when species richness was low and networks with greater species richness had a higher number of interactions. The distribution of interactions differed between environments but not due to network size and all were significantly nested. The robustness to cumulative extinctions showed a different pattern at each site; the most robust network was at Carrillo Puerto, which also was the site with less species. Sites with more endemic species (e.g. Tehuacan) had more specialized interactions, and were more susceptible to extinction.},

@article{Stouffer2014,
abstract = {There is increasing world-wide concern about the impact of the introduction of exotic species on ecological communities. Since many exotic plants depend on native pollinators to successfully establish, it is of paramount importance that we understand precisely how exotic species integrate into existing plant-pollinator communities. In this manuscript, we have studied a global data base of empirical pollination networks to determine whether community, network, species or interaction characteristics can help identify invaded communities. We found that a limited number of community and network properties showed significant differences among the empirical data sets - namely networks with exotic plants present are characterized by greater total, plant and pollinator richness, as well as higher values of relative nestedness. We also observed significant differences in terms of the pollinators that interact with the exotic plants. In particular, we found that specialist pollinators that are also weak contributors to community nestedness are far more likely to interact with exotic plants than would be expected by chance alone. By virtue of their interactions, it appears that exotic plants may provide a key service to a community's specialist pollinators as well as fill otherwise vacant 'coevolutionary niches'.},
